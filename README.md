# US-Accident-Analysis
## Problem Statement
Investigate the patterns and trends in accident occurrences across the United States from 2016 to 2023 to address the problem of increasing accident rates and their causes. Focus on city-specific accident rates, seasonal and time-of-day variations, and the impact of weather conditions. The goal is to identify key factors contributing to high accident frequencies and trends, including geographic and temporal patterns, to inform safety measures and traffic management strategies. The planning process will involve data collection, analysis, and the development of actionable insights to enhance road safety.
